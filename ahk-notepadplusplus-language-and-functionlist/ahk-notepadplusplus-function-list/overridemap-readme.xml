Follow the directions for the custom language highlight and function list files.

Both sections have to be completed for the language highlight and the function list to work.
========


This goes at the end of the association section of the overrideMap.xml 

WINDOWS:

DIRECTORY:

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\functionlist

FILENAME:

overrideMap.xml

Copy and paste the ahk-fl.xml file into the same functionlist directory.

Complete both sections, the overrideMap.xml and Language Highlight Sections

Then restart Notepad++

Open your .ahk file

Select the ahk language from the bottom of the language menu.

Open the function list by going to view, then ticking the function list at the bottom of the view menu.

You might have to click on and off the ahk file or refresh the function list to see if everything worked properly. But if it did work, you should see all your functions and all the hot keys with :: in the name.
